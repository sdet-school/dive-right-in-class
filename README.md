Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 
<br />
Welcome to SDET School!
<br />
If you have any problems with the set up steps below, or just have questions about anything, head over to our friendly [Slack group](https://sdetschool.slack.com/) ðŸ˜‰
<br />
Let's get started, shall we?

### First off, there are some things you need to install:

1. [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com). You will use it to view your changes, commit code and push it to GitHub.
2. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). Text editor you will use to edit your code.
3. Install Python (the programming language we will be using):

[Instructions for Windows users.](https://www.notion.so/Install-Python-on-Windows-8a2ece34c0d745cebe76a9b65b4c712c)

[Instructions for Mac users.](https://www.notion.so/Install-Python-on-a-Mac-23e17907109249f482d3341f3cad256f)

4. "Pull" this repository onto your computer.
  - Create a folder named `Developer` on your computer: in your home directory if you're on a Mac or in any directory you prefer if you're on Windows.
  - Click the `Code` button above and Open in GitHub Desktop":

  If `Github Desktop` is not opened automatically, open it, go to File -> Clone Repository -> URL -> https://github.com/sdet-school/dive-right-in-class.git -> Clone:

> You should now have the repo "checked out" on your computer!
  
4. Install Selenium. Selenium is just a tool that clicks on things in the browser, that's it!

[Instructions for Windows users](https://www.notion.so/How-to-get-started-with-Selenium-on-Windows-38f909bf451b4df79caed5b2ec1f180b)

Pfffft, you're done! Couldn't quite get it to work? It's OK. Head over to the SDET School's [Slack community](sdetschool.slack.com) and we'll help you to get going in no time.

If it worked, still pop into the community and say hi!
